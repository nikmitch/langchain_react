# langchain_react
Trying to make some basic agents with tool-calling capabilities.
_react_w_wiki_calc.ipynb_ was my first successful attempt at creating an agent. It has the ability to search through wikipedia articles and also use a calculator, and is run through the terminal.

I've decided to try to turn it into an app for easier interaction - see _app.py_. I removed the calculator functionality for now as it seems to be complicating things without adding much value
