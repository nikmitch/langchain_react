    "# ReAct agent with Wikipedia and calculator tool access\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to learn to make basic agents that can use tools. I found a YouTube video from June 2023 that used ReAct with Langchain to look stuff up with Wikipedia [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eug2clsLtFs). However, the code used there doesn't work any more (all been deprecated) so I had to do most of this from scratch. I added in a calculator tool as well (which was a bit messy as I had to define a wrapper for the class so it would have a description attribute). Seems to work reasonably well now"
